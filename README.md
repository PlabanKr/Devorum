# ForumApp

Young students often come up with with innovative project ideas. But many of these projects never get made because the students cannot find people to make the projects with. Devorum is a forum webapp where students will be able to share their project ideas in brief to find people who would want to make it with them.

A person will post their project idea in a forum. Others will be able to like that post. The people who like the project are interested in making that project with the person. The person will now be able to see the profiles of everyone who liked the post.

The profiles of each account will have the details of the skills that person has. Such as MERN, Python, Java, Unity, Blender, etc. And along with this people will be allowed to display their other qualifications on the profile.

Based on these profiles a person posting a project on the forum will be able to choose a collaborator for their project. They can connect with these people which will allow them to communicate with them and go into further details on the project.

The forums on the webapp can be Web Development, Game Development, A.I. and various other domains. There will be forums also based on country so that developers can look for collaborators from a specific country.
